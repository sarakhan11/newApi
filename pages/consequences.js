<h4 className="text-3xl text-gray-500 mt-3">As said above, company has a huge effect on a personâ€™s behavior, success, 
or nature. If you are surrounded by studious friends then you also become like them.
 i.e. studious. Also, if you are surrounded by people who smoke, drink alcohol or 
 possess bad habits then you too become like them. It is wisely said that the qualities
  get transferred from man to man. These qualities can either make or mar your future.
   Thus, all of us must spend the most of our times with the people who have good qualities.

   <h4 className="text-3xl text-gray-500 mt-3">
For instance, if you are in company with the people who are sporty then you too 
automatically turn into a sporty man. Every man has a good as well as bad corner.
 Thus, our responsibility is to collect the good qualities of that person and cultivate 
  in our behavior while neglecting the bad qualities. We can also focus on the negative
   qualities of a person and instruct him to leave those bad qualities. If we do so,
    we can say that the opposite person has our good company.
